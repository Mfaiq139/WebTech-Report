<h4>
  1. Project Description </h4><br>
 <p> Healthy eating is the theme we've chosen for this project. For this particular task, our group has decided to form a mock organisation. Healthy Eating is a non-profit organisation that aims to disseminate information about the importance of eating healthy. We have decided to create a platform where we can help everyone with our provided information and guidance in relation to Sustainable Goal Development, Goal 3: Good Health And Well Being, because our motto is "know more, feel better."

	Our website is divided into five sections: Why Healthy Meal, Healthy Food, About Your Body, About Us, and Contact. Some of the fonts we chose are Arial and Roboto because they are easy to read and make the contents look interesting. The overall design of this website is simple and minimalist, yet appealing to the eye, and it is user friendly for easy navigation. The background colour is black, and the elements used are colourized with a variety of colours such as white and grey to avoid looking dull and boring.

	For each of our pages, we distinguish each of the pages by different information. Why Healthy Meal will be a page that explains why the user should consider a healthy meal, there is also information regarding the benefit of healthy food and charts like the healthy food pyramid to enhance and emphasise healthy meal knowledge to the user. On the contrary, we decided to highlight recipes and videos related to health food in the “Health Food” section. Users will be provided with plenty of recipes and cooking videos related to healthy food. Our aim is to make the page as a guide for the user whenever they start to cook. We plan to update the recipe regularly to reach our user satisfaction.

	Furthermore, in the “about your body” page , we want to emphasise the healthy lifestyle to the user. In this section, users will be able to access news, tips, and exercise tutorials to guide them. We believe a healthy lifestyle is also an important factor to stay healthy. Next, we have a section where users will be able to read the purpose of our organisation. Lastly we have a contact section, we provide users with our email, contact number and question and advice form so it is easier for users to communicate with us.
